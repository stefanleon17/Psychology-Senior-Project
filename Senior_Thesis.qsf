The real goal of my research however, is looking at the connection between our perceptions of difficulty and performance. In reality, there is only one version of the game presented to all participants, which are only prompted with a message telling them they are playing a \"very easy\" or \"very hard\" version of the game. My hypothesis is that people will mostly perform better on tasks they perceive as easy, independently of the objective difficulty of the task.
